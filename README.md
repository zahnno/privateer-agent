A provider-agnostic terminal coding agent — **bring your own model**. Switch between
OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, and local Ollama with one command. Built on the Vercel
AI SDK, so tool-calling and streaming work identically across every provider.

```
    .-.
   (   )
    '+'
  ---+---       PRIVATEER
     |          bring your own model
     |
  \  |  /
   \_|_/
  (_/ \_)
```

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20
- An API key for at least one provider (or a local Ollama install)

## Install

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm link           # optional: put `privateer` on your PATH
```

Or run directly without linking:

```bash
npm start          # launches the interactive TUI
# or
node bin/privateer.mjs
```

## Configure a provider

Privateer reads credentials from environment variables or a config file.

**Env vars (quickest):**

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...      # gateway to ~everything
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api   # optional; defaults to this
```

**Config file** — `~/.privateer/config.json` (global) and/or `./.privateer/config.json` (per project):

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.8",
  "permissionMode": "default",
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": { "apiKey": "sk-or-..." },
    "anthropic":  { "apiKey": "sk-ant-..." }
  }
}
```

Override the config location with `PRIVATEER_HOME`.

## Usage

```bash
privateer                                   # interactive TUI with the default model
privateer -m openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.8
privateer -c                                # resume the last session in this dir
privateer -p "summarize src/"               # headless one-shot, prints to stdout
```

Run `/model` (no argument) to browse the models each configured provider actually
offers — the list is fetched live using the API key you entered, then filtered as you
type. Onboarding ends on the same picker so you choose your default model up front.

You can also pass a model string directly as `provider:model`:

| Example | |
|---|---|
| `openrouter:anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` | any model on OpenRouter |
| `anthropic:claude-opus-4-8` | direct Anthropic |
| `openai:gpt-5.5` | direct OpenAI |
| `ollama:qwen3-coder` | local model |

## Slash commands

`/help` `/model [spec]` `/provider` `/permissions [mode]` `/cost` `/init`
`/todo` `/compact` `/doctor` `/clear` `/exit`

- `/model` — open a picker of each provider's live models (or `/model provider:id` to set one directly).
- `/init` — the agent explores the repo and writes a `PRIVATEER.md` for you
  (`/init --stub` just drops an empty template, no model call).
- `/todo` — print the agent's current task list.
- `/compact` — summarize older history to reclaim context (also happens automatically).

While the agent is working, press **Esc** to interrupt the turn (partial output is kept);
**Ctrl-C** quits.

## Tools

`read` · `write` · `edit` · `glob` · `grep` · `bash` · `todo` · `task` ·
`web_fetch` · `web_search`

The file/search/shell tools are pure-Node (no external binaries required). Mutating tools
(write/edit/bash) and network tools (web_fetch/web_search) go through the permission gate.
`todo` maintains the live task list; `task` delegates an investigation to a read-only
sub-agent that returns a summary.

## Permission modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `default` | prompt before edits and shell commands |
| `acceptEdits` | auto-approve file edits; still prompt for other shell commands |
| `bypass` | no prompts (also `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) |
| `plan` | read-only; mutations are denied |

At an approval prompt: **y** allow once · **a** always · **n** deny.

## Project context

Create a `PRIVATEER.md` in your repo (via `/init`) to give the agent standing
context — conventions, architecture notes, anything it should always know.

## Develop

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Caveats

Privateer's agent core is built provider-agnostic from the ground up; a few areas are
deliberately simplified for now:

- **Prompt caching is Anthropic-only.** Ephemeral cache breakpoints are attached for direct
  Anthropic models and OpenRouter routes to `anthropic/*`. Other providers ignore them (a
  harmless no-op).
- **Sub-agents are synchronous.** A `task` runs one read-only child agent to completion and
  returns its summary — there's no parallel worker fan-out.
- **Compaction is heuristic.** Context size is estimated (~4 chars/token) and older history is
  summarized by a one-shot generate, not a structured-output schema. The most recent messages
  are always kept verbatim.
- **`web_search` scrapes DuckDuckGo's keyless HTML endpoint.** It needs no API key but is
  best-effort and can break if their markup changes. `web_fetch` is robust for known URLs.
- **Protected files** (`.env`, `.npmrc`, shell rc files, …) always prompt before edit — except
  in `bypass` mode, which by definition skips all prompts.
